# reccurse
a terminal record creator with ncurses

filemaker type with many customizable options

Reccurse has reached distribution phase. I think it's one of a kind, considering all years of computer software.

Executables has been compiled on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, OpenBSD 7.2, Fedora Workstation 36-37 and Arch Linux 2023.

If your OS is different from all the above, I will build it for you.

***caution: rename your executable to reccurse .It must be executed from it's containing directory.

Reccurse is proprietary software.
